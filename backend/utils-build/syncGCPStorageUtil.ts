/**
 * Utility to download or upload secrets files from/to GCP Cloud Storage.
 *
 * The GitHub repo does not store secrets files - these are stored in Cloud Storage.
 *
 * When you clone from the Git repo you need to create some directories and download these files.  When GCP triggers a build from Github it copies in the GitHub repo but also needs to copy the secrets files from Cloud Storage.  Therefore the files on the GCP Local Storage environment must be kept up to date.
 *
 * When the files are downloaded they are saved in a directory matching the Cloud Storage file path.  To make this give the expected result a directory on the Cloud Storage bucket is created that matches the name of the rootpath (i.e. the directory containing package.json) and a deltaPath is configured to each file from the root path and the local and Cloud Storage filepaths are constructed from that delta path.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * The utility is run from an npm script: 'npm run loadSecretsFiles'
 *
 * This utility imports a module that passes in an object that contains paths to the secrets files.
